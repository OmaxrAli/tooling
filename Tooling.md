### Task 2.1

# integrated development environmen IDEs:
## IDE	Visual Studio Code :

### Visual Studio Code :
well the VS code is an IDE (integrated development environment) and was ranked to be the most popular developer environment tool that is used for streamline coding technology that supports development with debugging, task running, intelligent code completion and version controls also users can make an additional functionality, made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and Mac.
it aims to provide the best tools for developers for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs

### PyCharm :
is a cross-platform IDE (integrated development environment) used in programming in a programming language called Python language and made by Czech company JetBrains works on Windows Linux and MacOS  and provides code analysis for the programmers such as unit tester, graphical debugger and supports web development with Django as well as data science with Anaconda.

# Operating System:

### Linux (Ubuntu): 
is an open source from Unix-Like operating system that is not popular between personals computers released on 1991 by Linus Torvalds Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution and is modeled on Unix and used for multi-user operating system.  
unlike windows Linux is based on commands more than icons or clicks and that made the Linux OS more secured than other systems.
working with commands is much better and reduces errors also since Linux is an open source that means that the system is modified by many programmers to make it butter and much flexible.

### Windows:
windows is an operating system made by Microsoft in 1985 and the most popular OS between the personal computers unlick Linux Windows uses graphical interface for commands and interactions which made it easier to the user and the icons were helping a lot.



# Version-control platform

### GitHub
Well gitHub is an open source community code hosting platform and that means that it can be updated by many sources of people either in gitHub itself or in its projects however it provides the abbility to work in many projects with other people anywhere also as you know GitHub supports every programming language, and all file types including images, videos, spreadsheets and text files.
It allows you to have your own version of the project in your local computer and allows you to be aware of the changes that happens in the project.


### GitLab
