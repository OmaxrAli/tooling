# tooling

### Task 2.1

# integrated development environmen IDEs:
## IDE	Visual Studio Code :

### Visual Studio Code :
well the VS code is an IDE (integrated development environment) and was ranked to be the most popular developer environment tool that is used for streamline coding technology that supports development with debugging, task running, intelligent code completion and version controls also users can make an additional functionality, made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and Mac.
it aims to provide the best tools for developers for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs

### PyCharm :
is a cross-platform IDE (integrated development environment) used in programming in a programming language called Python language and made by Czech company JetBrains works on Windows Linux and MacOS  and provides code analysis for the programmers such as unit tester, graphical debugger and supports web development with Django as well as data science with Anaconda.

# Operating System:

### Linux (Ubuntu): 
is an open source from Unix-Like operating system that is not popular between personals computers released on 1991 by Linus Torvalds Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution and is modeled on Unix and used for multi-user operating system.  
unlike windows Linux is based on commands more than icons or clicks and that made the Linux OS more secured than other systems.
working with commands is much better and reduces errors also since Linux is an open source that means that the system is modified by many programmers to make it butter and much flexible.

### Windows:
windows is an operating system made by Microsoft in 1985 and the most popular OS between the personal computers unlick Linux Windows uses graphical interface for commands and interactions which made it easier to the user and the icons were helping a lot.



# Version-control platform

### GitHub
Well gitHub is an open source community code hosting platform  and that means that it can be updated by many sources of people either in gitHub itself or in its projects however it provides the abbility to work in many projects with other people anywhere also as you know GitHub supports every programming language, and all file types including images, videos, spreadsheets and text files.
It allows you to have your own version of the project in your local computer and allows you to be aware of the changes that happens in the project.


### GitLab
Gitlab is an open-source project using a repository management system lunched in 2011 and used by more than 100000 deferent organizations, with GIT as the code management tool, and web services built on that foundation. Simply put, Gitlab is the same as Github, which is used to store the project's repository.
But the community wanted to distinguish itself from GitHub so the created the (DivOpslifecycle).
Providing issue tracker, continues integrations and continues delivery as part of the product.


### Task 2.2
i will be putting three main reasons for each choice.
### Visual Studio Code:

+ support for hundreds of programming languages
+ VS Code helps me be instantly productive with bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection and snippets.
+  Debugging is often the one feature that developers miss most in a leaner coding experience, and it is there

### Linux (Ubuntu): 

+ High stability The Linux system is very stable and is not prone to crashes
+ Free
+ Open source

### GitHub

+ Huge community over 20M users in github
+ Open source and that means its features are useble and editible
+ provides full control in a project through the bug tracker, the plugin arciticure.

### Task 2.3
### Visual Studio Code:

I used the vs code for the coding part however it was the best choice it provided many programming languages which made it much easier to swap through the project and making other types of files.

### Linux (Ubuntu): 
Using Linux(Ubuntu) through windows terminal was really great however it allowed me the creator to connect the work (project) with my git hub account.
Linux was smother and much stable and easier than windows through the project when ever you wanted to push or pull your work from GitHub


### GitHub
we needed a place to put our work in and to make a back-up resource.
a place that is good for a team together in so we can push or pull our work.
And keeping a good track with the work flow and changes 
Github was the best place, and it helped us to create our organization and to post our work for free.
