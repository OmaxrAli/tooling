 # Task 1.2
 
 ## Risks:
 
### Money: 
budget and in any project the money is the fuel we use to keep working if the project needed some changes, fixing, editing etc… we need this fuel to do these things and without them no work by doing that there’s no project.
### Solution:
You need to put a good budget that can handle the workers, the equipments, the changes, replacements and repairs.
Compare it with the cost from the client and know if that project is really good for you.  
### End User: 
as human each one has his unique way of thinking as well as the client we as developers we work hard to satisfy the client by doing what they ask for but we are not the client and the risks here are when he user don’t like our job or offer many changes to the project or cancelling the project or changing the concept of the project and the End user experience is everything if we did a good work or if we should do the job again it is up to the client.
### Solution:
Through each stage ask for a user feedback, and use prototypes to get the best kind. 

### Time:
 One of the greatest factors in a project time basically the factor that allows you to know when to start, when to work and when to deliver the project.
It allows you to manage the project and its tasks and if you did not know when to start and how to manage your work then you lost the control of the project.
### Solution:
Try to manage your time before you start and put a plan that suits the delivery time.
### Recourses:
That includes the workers, the equipment and the knowledge these are the main factors of a project is to know what you have to work for the project and how to keep and replace these kind of resources 
### Solution:
Just put a good kind of replacement to the damaged part of your resources like if a worker got sick put the best replacement for the job and you need to have a good back up plan.

### Coding and implementation technique

### Agile:
SDLC adaptive model used in a project management a plan we must follow to make a high-quality project.
The Agile uses an iterations or sprints to work on the project each sprint contains task and a working plan of the idea like Planning, testing, designing building and so.
 With great abilities like adding requirements editing and adding people changing the plan at any sprint.
 
#### Agile’s methods:
The Agile SDLC is following three methods in it’s work flow as for us we will be using the Scrum method in our work flow.
I will be talking about like three of them.

#### Scrum method:
Scrum is what we are using in that project and it is an agile method project management framework that can be used to manage iterative and incremental projects of all types.
It is the most popular method and its usage is increasing over the years because its simplicity and productivity.

### Testing technique
Black Box Testing :
is a way to test the code with only through the output not looking for the code it-self.
